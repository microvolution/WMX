# What Is In WMX?

## Demos
You'll find demo applications in the Demos folder.

Note: Most demos have a readme associated with them, and they may have vital configuration information that should be applied when using the feature(s) in your own projects.

## Features
The Features folder contains more feature-rich cross-platform implementations of APIs. These are structured in such a way so as to shield your cross-platform code from the platform-specific implementation. There are demos for each of the features in the Demos folder Features include (amongst others):

### AudioManager
Play audio files on Android and Windows. Specifically constructed to allow synchronization of audio.

# License
WMX is licensed under MIT, and the license file is included in this folder.
